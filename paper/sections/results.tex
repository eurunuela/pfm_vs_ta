\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Methods on how we're doing simulations and results (with simulations and experimental data)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different SNRs and maybe even use CAPs
        \item Selection of HRF explained if both use the same but it's different from what's used for simulating.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What happens? For example with gamma for simulating.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Selection of regularization parameter
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Present with real data on a voxel
        \end{itemize}
