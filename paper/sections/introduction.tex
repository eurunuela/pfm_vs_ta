\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Talk about our motivation for this paper.

    \item We could mention iCAPs Neuron, and papers with applications like PFM, TA, clinical patient papers with iCAPs.

    \item Apart from [[Richard F. Betzel]]'s work~\cite{betzel2020temporal,esfahlani2020high,faskowitz2020edge}, we could mention the connection with the
    [[Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives]] method~\cite{shine2015estimation,shine2016dynamics}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item These are basically calculating the derivative, which is the same as applying a high-pass filter and calculating the correlation.
    \end{itemize}
