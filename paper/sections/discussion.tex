\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pros and cons of each formulation: analysis vs synthesis
    \item Link with other approaches
    \item Finish with conclusions and a moving forward
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We have to refine the deconvolution
        \item HRF variability there are three: conference proceeding by Philippe~\cite{badillo2013group}, ISBI 2012 by CÃ©sar~\cite{gaudes2012structured}, and Farouj with a different formulation. Say conceptual differences among those.
        \item Mention stability-selection~\cite{meinshausen2010stability}
        \item Debiasing
        \item Connected to debiasing other deconvolution algorithms that are based on a norm lower than 1.
