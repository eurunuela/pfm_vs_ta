Functional MRI deconvolution algorithms are gaining popularity to study the dynamicss of functional brain activity and connectivity at short timescales. This work sheds light on our understanding of two state-of-the-art approaches based on L1-norm regularized estimators: Paradigm Free Mapping (synthesis model) and Total Activation (analysis model). Through simulations with varying signal-to-noise ratios, and experimental data comprising a motor task and two resting-state datasets, we demonstrate that both techniques perform temporal deconvolution of fMRI data identically. In other words, the two methods yield identical estimates of the innovation and activity-inducing signals underlying BOLD events when an identical hemodynamic response function and regularization parameters are used. These observations open up the possibility for future developments without questioning their core formulation and performance.
