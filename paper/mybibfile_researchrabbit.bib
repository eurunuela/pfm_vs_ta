As more complicated questions arise about brain function, such as spontaneous and resting-state activity, new methodologies are required. We propose total activation (TA) as a novel fMRI data analysis method to explore the underlying activity-inducing signal of the BOLD signal without any timing information that is based on sparse spatio-temporal priors and characterization of the hemodynamic system. Within a variational framework, we formulate a convex cost function-including spatial and temporal regularization terms-that is solved by fast iterative shrinkage algorithms. The temporal regularization expresses that the activity-inducing signal is block-type without restrictions on the timing nor duration. The spatial regularization favors coherent activation patterns in anatomically-defined brain regions. TA is evaluated using a software phantom and an event-related fMRI experiment with prolonged resting state periods disturbed by visual stimuli. The results illustrate that both block-type and spike-type activities can be recovered successfully without prior knowledge of the experimental paradigm. Further processing using hierarchical clustering shows that the activity-inducing signals revealed by TA contain information about meaningful task-related and resting-state networks, demonstrating good abilities for the study of non-stationary dynamics of brain activity.

The proposed method is evaluated on real fMRI data and compared with both the original SPFM algorithm and conventional analysis with a general linear model (GLM) that is aware of the temporal model of the neuronal-related activity. We demonstrate that the novel stability-based SPFM algorithm yields activation maps with higher resemblance to the maps obtained with GLM analyses and offers improved detection of neuronal-related events over SPFM, particularly in scenarios with low contrast-to-noise ratio.}}

It is generally assumed that the connectivity of these networks is static in time and constant over the whole network, although there is increasing evidence that this view is too simplistic. This work proposes novel techniques to investigate the contribution of spontaneous BOLD events to the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity as assessed by ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results show that: 1) spontaneous events in recognised brain networks contribute significantly to network connectivity estimates; 2) these spontaneous events do not necessarily involve whole networks or nodes, but clusters of voxels which act in concert, forming transiently synchronising sub-networks and 3) a task can significantly alter the number of localised spontaneous events that are detected within a single network. These findings support the notion that spontaneous events are the main driver of the large scale networks that are commonly detected by seed-based correlation and ICA. Furthermore, we found that large scale networks are manifestations of smaller, transiently synchronising sub-networks acting dynamically in concert, corresponding to spontaneous events, and which do not necessarily involve all voxels within the network nodes oscillating in unison.}}

In this paper, we aimed for the robust estimation of the parameters and states of the hemodynamic model by using blood oxygen level dependent signal. Approach. In the fMRI literature, there are only a few successful methods that are able to make a joint estimation of the states and parameters of the hemodynamic model. In this paper, we implemented a maximum likelihood based method called the particle smoother expectation maximization (PSEM) algorithm for the joint state and parameter estimation. Main results. Former sequential Monte Carlo methods were only reliable in the hemodynamic state estimates. They were claimed to outperform the local linearization (LL) filter and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The PSEM algorithm is compared with the most successful method called square-root cubature Kalman smoother (SCKS) for both state and parameter estimation. SCKS was found to be better than the dynamic expectation maximization (DEM) algorithm, which was shown to be a better estimator than EKF, LL and particle filters. Significance. PSEM was more accurate than SCKS for both the state and the parameter estimation. Hence, PSEM seems to be the most accurate method for the system identification and state estimation for the hemodynamic model inversion literature. This paper do not compare its results with Tikhonov-regularized Newton—CKF (TNF-CKF), a recent robust method which works in filtering sense.}}

Among these issues lies the variability of the hemodynamic response function (HRF), that is usually accounted for using functional basis sets in the general linear model context. Here, we use the joint detection-estimation approach (JDE) (Makni et al., 2008; Vincent et al., 2010) which combines regional nonparametric HRF inference with spatially adaptive regularization of activation clusters to avoid global smoothing of fMRI images. We show that the JDE-based inference brings a significant improvement in statistical sensitivity for detecting evoked activity in parietal regions. In contrast, the canonical HRF associated with spatially adaptive regularization is more sensitive in other regions, such as motor cortex. This different regional behavior is shown to reflect a larger discrepancy of HRF with the canonical model. By varying parallel imaging acceleration factor, SNR-specific region-based hemodynamic parameters (activation delay and duration) were extracted from the JDE inference. Complementary analyses highlighted their significant departure from the canonical parameters and the strongest between-subject variability that occurs in the parietal region, irrespective of the SNR value. Finally, statistical evidence that the fluctuation of the HRF shape is responsible for the significant change in activation detection performance is demonstrated using paired t-tests between hemodynamic parameters inferred by GLM and JDE.}}

However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be significantly better, both theoretically and practically.

However, tracking statistically meaningful reconfigurations across time has proven difficult. This has to do largely with issues related to sampling variability, making instantaneous estimation of network organization difficult, along with increased reliance on task-free (cognitively unconstrained) experimental paradigms, limiting the ability to interpret the origin of changes in network structure over time. Here, we address these challenges using time-varying network analysis in conjunction with a naturalistic viewing paradigm. Specifically, we developed a measure of inter-subject network similarity and used this measure as a coincidence filter to identify synchronous fluctuations in network organization across individuals. Applied to movie-watching data, we found that periods of high inter-subject similarity coincided with reductions in network modularity and increased connectivity between cognitive systems. In contrast, low inter-subject similarity was associated with increased system segregation and more rest-like architectures. We then used a data-driven approach to uncover clusters of functional connections that follow similar trajectories over time and are more strongly correlated during movie-watching than at rest. Finally, we show that synchronous fluctuations in network architecture over time can be linked to a subset of features in the movie. Our findings link dynamic fluctuations in network integration and segregation to patterns of inter-subject similarity, and suggest that moment-to-moment fluctuations in functional connectivity reflect shared cognitive processing across individuals.}}

Characterizing large-scale network dynamics at rest has the potential to provide new insights into the complexity of such functional alterations. In this case-control study, we explored the dynamic properties of large-scale functional networks during rest in 25 healthy controls and 32 patients with progressive multiple sclerosis, using the innovation-driven co-activation patterns. Thirty-five subjects also underwent a one-year follow-up examination. Partial least squares correlation analysis was applied to explore the relationship between functional dynamics and clinical disability. We observed a reduced dynamic engagement of the anterior default mode network and its coupling with the executive-control network in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis compared to controls, at baseline and follow-up. The global and motor disabilities were related to functional dynamics of subcortical, sensory-motor and posterior default mode network, while the cognitive disability was associated to the altered dynamics of anterior default mode, visual and temporal networks. These findings reveal that the anterior default mode functional recruitment and its interaction with other networks play a major role in the functional reorganization occurring during the progressive stage of multiple sclerosis. Also, the dynamic properties of large-scale functional networks are steady over one year and unveil the intricate relationship between brain function and clinical disability.}}

Second, responses to long-duration stimuli can be predicted from responses to shorter duration stimuli. Third, the noise in the fMRI data is independent of stimulus contrast and temporal period.

Suppose we seek the sparsest solution, i.e., the one with the fewest nonzero entries. Can it ever be unique? If so, when? As optimization of sparsity is combinatorial in nature, are there efficient methods for finding the sparsest solution? These questions have been answered positively and constructively in recent years, exposing a wide variety of surprising phenomena, in particular the existence of easily verifiable conditions under which optimally sparse solutions can be found by concrete, effective computational methods.

Such theoretical results inspire a bold perspective on some important practical problems in signal and image processing. Several well-known signal and image processing problems can be cast as demanding solutions of undetermined systems of equations. Such problems have previously seemed, to many, intractable, but there is considerable evidence that these problems often have sparse solutions. Hence, advances in finding sparse solutions to underdetermined systems have energized research on such signal and image processing problems—to striking effect.

In this paper we review the theoretical results on sparse solutions of linear systems, empirical results on sparse modeling of signals and images, and recent applications in inverse problems and compression in image processing. This work lies at the intersection of signal processing and applied mathematics, and arose initially from the wavelets and harmonic analysis research communities. The aim of this paper is to introduce a few key notions and applications connected to sparsity, targeting newcomers interested in either the mathematical aspects of this area or its applications.}}

While the BOLD signal is a valid measure of neuronal activity, variances in fluctuations of the BOLD signal are not only due to fluctuations in neural activity. Thus, a remaining problem in neuroimaging analyses is developing methods that ensure specific inferences about neural activity that are not confounded by unrelated sources of noise in the BOLD signal. Here, we develop and test a new algorithm for performing semiblind (i.e., no knowledge of stimulus timings) deconvolution of the BOLD signal that treats the neural event as an observable, but intermediate, probabilistic representation of the system's state. We test and compare this new algorithm against three other recent deconvolution algorithms under varied levels of autocorrelated and Gaussian noise, hemodynamic response function (HRF) misspecification and observation sampling rate. Further, we compare the algorithms' performance using two models to simulate BOLD data: a convolution of neural events with a known (or misspecified) HRF versus a biophysically accurate balloon model of hemodynamics. We also examine the algorithms' performance on real task data. The results demonstrated good performance of all algorithms, though the new algorithm generally outperformed the others (3.0% improvement) under simulated resting-state experimental conditions exhibiting multiple, realistic confounding factors (as well as 10.3% improvement on a real Stroop task). The simulations also demonstrate that the greatest negative influence on deconvolution accuracy is observation sampling rate. Practical and theoretical implications of these results for improving inferences about neural activity from fMRI BOLD signal are discussed.}}

Our approach includes two improvements over the current best performing deconvolution approach; 1) we optimize the parametric form of the deconvolution feature space; and, 2) we pre-classify neural event estimates into two subgroups, either  known  or  unknown , based on the confidence of the estimates prior to conducting neural event classification. This knows-what-it-knows approach significantly improves neural event classification over the current best performing algorithm, as tested in a detailed computer simulation of highly-confounded fMRI BOLD signal. We then implemented a massively parallelized version of the bootstrapping-based deconvolution algorithm and executed it on a high-performance computer to conduct large scale (i.e., voxelwise) estimation of the neural events for a group of 17 human subjects. We show that by restricting the computation of inter-regional correlation to include only those neural events estimated with high-confidence the method appeared to have higher sensitivity for identifying the default mode network compared to a standard BOLD signal correlation analysis when compared across subjects.}}

We recently introduced paradigm free mapping (PFM), an analysis method that detects single trial blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses without specifying prior information on the timing of the events. PFM is based on the deconvolution of the fMRI signal using a linear hemodynamic convolution model. Our previous PFM method (Caballero-Gaudes et al., 2011: Hum Brain Mapp) used the ridge regression estimator for signal deconvolution and required a baseline signal period for statistical inference. In this work, we investigate the application of sparse regression techniques in PFM. In particular, a novel PFM approach is developed using the Dantzig selector estimator, solved via an efficient homotopy procedure, along with statistical model selection criteria. Simulation results demonstrated that, using the Bayesian information criterion to select the regularization parameter, this method obtains high detection rates of the BOLD responses, comparable with a model-based analysis, but requiring no information on the timing of the events and being robust against hemodynamic response function variability. The practical operation of this sparse PFM method was assessed with single-trial fMRI data acquired at 7T, where it automatically detected all task-related events, and was an improvement on our previous PFM method, as it does not require the definition of a baseline state and amplitude thresholding and does not compromise on specificity and sensitivity.

These approaches induce a bias as they do not account for latencies in the cognitive responses compared to EP and cannot be applied to resting-state data as no EP is available.

Functional connectivity measures usually assume a stable relationship over time; however, accumulating studies have reported time-varying properties of strength and spatial distribution of functional connectivity. The present study explored the modulation of functional connectivity between two regions by a third region using the physiophysiological interaction (PPI) technique. We first identified eight brain networks and two regions of interest (ROIs) representing each of the networks using a spatial independent component analysis. A voxel-wise analysis was conducted to identify regions that showed modulatory interactions (PPI) with the two ROIs of each network. Mostly, positive modulatory interactions were observed within regions involved in the same system. For example, the two regions of the dorsal attention network revealed modulatory interactions with the regions related to attention, while the two regions of the extrastriate network revealed modulatory interactions with the regions in the visual cortex. In contrast, the two regions of the default mode network (DMN) revealed negative modulatory interactions with the regions in the executive network, and vice versa, suggesting that the activities of one network may be associated with smaller within network connectivity of the competing network. These results validate the use of PPI analysis to study modulation of resting-state functional connectivity by a third region. The modulatory effects may provide a better understanding of complex brain functions.}}

We aimed to characterize large-scale modulatory interactions by performing region-of-interest (ROI)-based physiophysiological interaction analysis on resting-state fMRI data. Modulatory interactions were calculated for every possible combination of three ROIs among 160 ROIs sampling the whole brain. Firstly, among all of the significant modulatory interactions, there were considerably more negative than positive effects; i.e., in more cases, an increase of activity in one region was associated with decreased functional connectivity between two other regions. Next, modulatory interactions were categorized as to whether the three ROIs were from one single network module, two modules, or three different modules (defined by a modularity analysis on their functional connectivity). Positive modulatory interactions were more represented than expected in cases in which the three ROIs were from a single module, suggesting an increase within module processing efficiency through positive modulatory interactions. In contrast, negative modulatory interactions were more represented than expected in cases in which the three ROIs were from two modules, suggesting a tendency of between-module segregation through negative modulatory interactions. Regions that were more likely to have modulatory interactions were then identified. The numbers of significant modulatory interactions for different regions were correlated with the regions' connectivity strengths and connection degrees. These results demonstrate whole-brain characteristics of modulatory interactions and may provide guidance for future studies of connectivity dynamics in both resting state and task state.}}

We analyzed 6 block-designed and 1 event-related designed functional MRI data, and examined whole-brain task modulated connectivity in various task domains, including emotion, reward, language, relation, social cognition, working memory, and inhibition. By using psychophysiological interaction between pairs of regions from the whole brain, we identified statistically significant task modulated connectivity in 4 tasks between their experimental and respective control conditions. Task modulated connectivity was found not only between regions that were activated during the task but also regions that were not activated or deactivated, suggesting a broader involvement of brain regions in a task than indicated by simple regional activations. Decreased functional connectivity was observed in all the 4 tasks and sometimes reduced connectivity was even between regions that were both activated during the task. This suggests that brain regions that are activated together do not necessarily work together. The current study demonstrates the comprehensive task connectomes of 4 tasks, and suggested complex relationships between regional activations and connectivity changes.}}

Much of the literature on this topic can be divided between analysis-based and synthesis-based priors. Analysis-based priors assign probability to a signal through various forward measurements of it, while synthesis-based priors seek a reconstruction of the signal as a combination of atom signals. The algebraic similarity between the two suggests that they could be strongly related; however, in the absence of a detailed study, contradicting approaches have emerged. While the computationally intensive synthesis approach is receiving ever-increasing attention and is notably preferred, other works hypothesize that the two might actually be much closer, going as far as to suggest that one can approximate the other. In this paper we describe the two prior classes in detail, focusing on the distinction between them. We show that although in the simpler complete and undercomplete formulations the two approaches are equivalent, in their overcomplete formulation they depart. Focusing on the l1 case, we present a novel approach for comparing the two types of priors based on high-dimensional polytopal geometry. We arrive at a series of theoretical and numerical results establishing the existence of an unbridgeable gap between the two.}}

The processes that give rise to correlated activity are, however, poorly understood. Here we decompose resting-state functional connectivity using a temporal unwrapping procedure to assess the contributions of moment-to-moment activity cofluctuations to the overall connectivity pattern. This approach temporally resolves functional connectivity at a timescale of single frames, which enables us to make direct comparisons of cofluctuations of network organization with fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series. We show that surprisingly, only a small fraction of frames exhibiting the strongest cofluctuation amplitude are required to explain a significant fraction of variance in the overall pattern of connection weights as well as the network’s modular structure. These frames coincide with frames of high BOLD activity amplitude, corresponding to activity patterns that are remarkably consistent across individuals and identify fluctuations in default mode and control network activity as the primary driver of resting-state functional connectivity. Finally, we demonstrate that cofluctuation amplitude synchronizes across subjects during movie watching and that high-amplitude frames carry detailed information about individual subjects (whereas low-amplitude frames carry little). Our approach reveals fine-scale temporal structure of resting-state functional connectivity and discloses that frame-wise contributions vary across time. These observations illuminate the relation of brain activity to functional connectivity and open a number of directions for future research.}}

A sequential minimization of two functionals is deployed: the first functional recovers activity signals with sparse transients while the second exploits the retrieved activity moments to estimate the Taylor expansion coefficients of the HRF. These coefficients are inherently linked to two values of interests that characterize the haemodynamics: time-to-peak and the width of the response.

Most current analysis methods hypothesise sustained FC within the duration of a task, but this assumption has been shown too limiting by recent imaging studies. While several methods have been proposed to study functional dynamics during rest, task-based studies are yet to fully disentangle network modulations.  Here, we propose a seed-based method to probe task-dependent modulations of brain activity by revealing Psychophysiological Interactions of Co-activation Patterns (PPI-CAPs). This point process-based approach temporally decomposes task-modulated connectivity into dynamic building blocks which cannot be captured by current methods, such as PPI or Dynamic Causal Modelling. Additionally, it identifies the occurrence of co-activation patterns at single frame resolution as opposed to window-based methods.  In a naturalistic setting where participants watched a TV program, we retrieved several patterns of co-activation with a posterior cingulate cortex seed whose occurrence rates and polarity varied depending on the context; on the seed activity; or on an interaction between the two. Moreover, our method exposed the consistency in effective connectivity patterns across subjects and time, allowing us to uncover links between PPI-CAPs and specific stimuli contained in the video.  Our study reveals that explicitly tracking connectivity pattern transients is paramount to advance our understanding of how different brain areas dynamically communicate when presented with a set of cues.}}

The action or path-integral of free-energy represents a lower bound on the model's log-evidence or marginal likelihood required for model selection and averaging. This approach rests on formulating the optimisation dynamically, in generalised coordinates of motion. The resulting scheme can be used for online Bayesian inversion of nonlinear dynamic causal models and is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Kalman and particle filtering.

A repeated trial paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s and intertrial times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to be nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not be predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a rectangular function. In the short-time regime, the amplitude of the response varied only slowly with stimulus duration. It was found that this character was predicted with a modification to Buxton's balloon model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur the response to concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual rates. Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the response to fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The deconvolution filter must be measured for each subject using a short-stimulus paradigm. It is concluded that deconvolution may be effective in diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal blurring and may have potential applications in quantitating responses in eventrelated fMRI.}}

This is true for both rest and task scenarios. Moreover, it is well accepted that task engagement alters FC, and that dynamic estimates of FC during and before task events can help predict their nature and performance. Yet, when it comes to dynamic FC (dFC) during rest, there is no consensus about its origin or significance. Some argue that rest dFC reflects fluctuations in on-going cognition, or is a manifestation of intrinsic brain maintenance mechanisms, which could have predictive clinical value. Conversely, others have concluded that rest dFC is mostly the result of sampling variability, head motion or fluctuating sleep states. Here, we present novel analyses suggesting that rest dFC is influenced by short periods of spontaneous cognitive-task-like processes, and that the cognitive nature of such mental processes can be inferred blindly from the data. As such, several different behaviorally relevant whole-brain FC configurations may occur during a single rest scan even when subjects were continuously awake and displayed minimal motion. In addition, using low dimensional embeddings as visualization aids, we show how FC states—commonly used to summarize and interpret resting dFC—can accurately and robustly reveal periods of externally imposed tasks; however, they may be less effective in capturing periods of distinct cognition during rest.}}

Because the underlying generative model is formulated in continuous time (with a discrete observation process) it can be applied to a wide variety of models specified with either ordinary or stochastic differential equations. These are an important class of models that are particularly appropriate for biological time-series, where the underlying system is specified in terms of kinetics or dynamics (i.e., dynamic causal models). We provide comparative evaluations with generalized Bayesian filtering (dynamic expectation maximization) and demonstrate marked improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency. We compare the schemes using a series of difficult (nonlinear) toy examples and conclude with a special focus on hemodynamic models of evoked brain responses in fMRI. Our scheme promises to provide a significant advance in characterizing the functional architectures of distributed neuronal systems, even in the absence of known exogenous (experimental) input; e.g., resting state fMRI studies and spontaneous fluctuations in electrophysiological studies.

The translation of resulting neural activation into a hemodynamic response is commonly approximated with a linear convolution model using a hemodynamic response function (HRF). There are two major limitations in GLM analysis. First, the GLM assumes that neural activation is either on or off and matches the exact stimulus duration in the corresponding task timings. Second, brain networks observed in resting-state fMRI experiments present also during task experiments, but the GLM approach models these task-unrelated brain activity as noise. A novel kernel matrix factorization approach, called hemodynamic matrix factorization (HMF), is therefore proposed that addresses both limitations by assuming that task-related and task-unrelated brain activity can be modeled with the same convolution model as in GLM analysis. By contrast to the GLM, the proposed HMF is a blind source separation (BSS) technique, which decomposes fMRI data into modes. Each mode comprises of a neural activation time course and a spatial mapping. Two versions of HMF are proposed in which the neural activation time course of each mode is convolved with either the canonical HRF or predetermined subject-specific HRFs.  Firstly, HMF with the canonical HRF is applied to two open-source cohorts. These cohorts comprise of several task experiments including motor, incidental memory, spatial coherence discrimination, verbal discrimination task and a very short localization task, engaging multiple parts of the eloquent cortex. HMF modes were obtained whose neural activation time course followed original task timings and whose corresponding spatial map matched cortical areas known to be involved in the respective task processing.  Secondly, the alignment of these neural activation time courses to task timings were further improved by replacing the canonical HRF with subject-specific HRFs during HMF mode computation.  In addition to task-related modes, HMF also produced seemingly task-unrelated modes whose spatial maps matched known resting-state networks.  The validity of a fMRI task experiment relies on the assumption that the exposure to a stimulus for a given time causes an imminent increase in neural activation of equal duration. The proposed HMF is an attempt to falsify this assumption and allows to identify subject task participation that does not comply with the experiment instructions.}}

We validate our model on the recently published Midnight Scanning Club dataset including five hours of task-free and six hours of various task experiments per subject. The resulting temporal and spatial activation patterns obtained from our matrix factorization technique resemble individual task profiles and known functional brain networks, which are either correlated with the task or spontaneously activating unrelated to the task.}}

Here we generalize conventional TV in 1-D by extending the derivative operator, which is within the regularization term, to any linear differential operator. This provides flexibility for tailoring the approach to the presence of nontrivial linear systems and for different types of driving signals such as spike-like, piecewise-constant, and so on. Conventional TV remains a special case of this general framework. We illustrate the feasibility of the method by considering a nontrivial linear system and different types of driving signals.}}

Decomposing resting-state fMRI using iCAPs reveals the rich spatiotemporal structure of functional components that dynamically assemble known resting-state networks. The temporal overlap between iCAPs is substantial; typically, three to four iCAPs occur simultaneously in combinations that are consistent with their behaviour profiles. In contrast to conventional connectivity analysis, which suggests a negative correlation between fluctuations in the default-mode network (DMN) and task-positive networks, we instead find evidence for two DMN-related iCAPs consisting the posterior cingulate cortex that differentially interact with the attention network. These findings demonstrate how the fMRI resting state can be functionally decomposed into spatially and temporally overlapping building blocks using iCAPs.}}

Only a handful of studies have probed the organization of spinal resting-state fluctuations, always using static measures of connectivity. Many innovative approaches have emerged for analyzing dynamics of brain fMRI, but they have not yet been applied to the spinal cord, although they could help disentangle its functional architecture. Here, we leverage a dynamic connectivity method based on the clustering of hemodynamic-informed transients to unravel the rich dynamic organization of spinal resting-state signals. We test this approach in 19 healthy subjects, uncovering fine-grained spinal components and highlighting their neuroanatomical and physiological nature.

To address this, we propose a novel analysis method that uses clustering analysis to sort and selectively average fMRI activity time frames to produce a set of co-activation patterns.

One intriguing aspect of spontaneous activity is an apparent nonstationarity, or variability of interaction between brain regions. It was recently proposed that spontaneous brain activity may be dominated by brief traces of activity, possibly originating from a neuronal avalanching phenomenon. Such traces may involve different subregions in a network at different times, potentially reflecting functionally relevant relationships that are not captured with conventional data analysis. To investigate this, we examined publicly available functional magnetic resonance imaging data with a dedicated analysis method and found indications that functional networks inferred from conventional correlation analysis may indeed be driven by activity at only a few critical time points. Subsequent analysis of the activity at these critical time points revealed multiple spatial patterns, each distinctly different from the established functional networks. The spatial distribution of these patterns suggests a potential functional relevance.}}

However, scalp EEG is insensitive to activity restricted to deep structures and recording the EEG in the scanner is complex and results in major artifacts that are difficult to remove.  This study presents a new framework for identifying the BOLD manifestations of epileptic discharges without having to record the EEG. The first stage is based on the detection of epileptic events for each voxel by sparse representation in the wavelet domain. The second stage is to gather voxels according to proximity in time and space of detected activities.  This technique was evaluated on data generated by superposing artificial responses at different locations and responses amplitude in the brain for 6 control subject runs. The method was able to detect effectively and consistently for responses amplitude of at least 1% above baseline. 46 runs from 15 patients with focal epilepsy were investigated. The results demonstrate that the method detected at least one concordant event in 37/41 runs. The maps of activation obtained from our method were more similar to those obtained by EEG–fMRI than to those obtained by the other method used in this context, 2D-Temporal Cluster Analysis. For 5 runs without event read on scalp EEG, 3 runs showed an activation concordant with the patient's diagnostic.  It may therefore be possible, at least when spikes are infrequent, to detect their BOLD manifestations without having to record the EEG.}}

In order to overcome this issue, we propose a novel framework that
separates the spatial and temporal components of the prediction by decoding the fMRI time-series continuously, i.e. scan-by-scan. The stimulation events can then be identified through a deconvolution of the reconstructed time series. We show that this model performs as well as or better than standard approaches across several datasets, most notably in regimes with small inter-stimuli intervals (3 to 5s), while also offering predictions
that are highly interpretable in the time domain. This opens the way toward analyzing datasets not normally thought of as suitable for decoding and makes it possible to run decoding on studies with reduced scan time.}}

Recent advents of the Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) have extended this efficient estimation property to nonlinear systems, and also to hybrid nonlinear problems where by the processes are continuous and the observations are discrete (continuous-discrete CD-CKF). Employing CKF techniques, therefore, carries high promise for modeling many biological phenomena where the underlying processes exhibit inherently nonlinear, continuous, and noisy dynamics and the associated measurements are uncertain and time-sampled. This paper investigates the performance of cubature filtering (CKF and CD-CKF) in two flagship problems arising in the field of neuroscience upon relating brain functionality to aggregate neurophysiological recordings: (i) estimation of the firing dynamics and the neural circuit model parameters from electric potentials (EP) observations, and (ii) estimation of the hemodynamic model parameters and the underlying neural drive from BOLD (fMRI) signals. First, in simulated neural circuit models, estimation accuracy was investigated under varying levels of observation noise (SNR), process noise structures, and observation sampling intervals (dt). When compared to the CKF, the CD-CKF consistently exhibited better accuracy for a given SNR, sharp accuracy increase with higher SNR, and persistent error reduction with smaller dt. Remarkably, CD-CKF accuracy shows only a mild deterioration for non-Gaussian process noise, specifically with Poisson noise, a commonly assumed form of background fluctuations in neuronal systems. Second, in simulated hemodynamic models, parametric estimates were consistently improved under CD-CKF. Critically, time-localization of the underlying neural drive, a determinant factor in fMRI-based functional connectivity studies, was significantly more accurate under CD-CKF. In conclusion, and with the CKF recently benchmarked against other advanced Bayesian techniques, the CD-CKF framework could provide significant gains in robustness and accuracy when estimating a variety of biological phenomena models where the underlying process dynamics unfold at time scales faster than those seen in collected measurements.}}

In this study, however, we examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the BOLD fluctuations to identify common patterns of propagation within a scan. A novel pattern finding algorithm was developed for detecting repeated spatiotemporal patterns in BOLD fMRI data. The algorithm was applied to high temporal resolution T2*-weighted multislice images obtained from rats and humans in the absence of any task or stimulation. In rats, the primary pattern consisted of waves of high signal intensity, propagating in a lateral to medial direction across the cortex, replicating our previous findings (Majeed et al., 2009a). These waves were observed primarily in sensorimotor cortex, but also extended to visual and parietal association areas. A secondary pattern, confined to subcortical regions consisted of an initial increase and subsequent decrease in signal intensity in the caudate–putamen. In humans, the most common spatiotemporal pattern consisted of an alteration between activation of areas comprising the “default-mode” (e.g., posterior cingulate and anterior medial prefrontal cortices) and the “task-positive” (e.g., superior parietal and premotor cortices) networks. Signal propagation from focal starting points was also observed. The pattern finding algorithm was shown to be reasonably insensitive to the variation in user-defined parameters, and the results were consistent within and between subjects. This novel approach for probing the spontaneous network activity of the brain has implications for the interpretation of conventional functional connectivity studies, and may increase the amount of information that can be obtained from neuroimaging data.}}

These spontaneous fluctuations appear to originate from the same source as the task-related BOLD response, leading to the hypothesis that correlated fluctuations reflect coordinated variations in neural activity (2). The possibility that correlated LFFs reflect the spontaneous “functional connectivity” of the brain has excited the interest of the fMRI and neuroscience communities, and the number of studies using the technique is growing rapidly.

Most research performed on LFFs falls into three categories. The first involves mapping functional networks in the brain. Networks associated with different systems including visual, motor, auditory, memory, and language have been detected in resting state fMRI studies (3,4). In addition, researchers have identified two widely present networks, one containing areas that are typically deactivated during a task (the “default mode” network) and another containing areas that are active during a wide variety of tasks and that may be related to attention (5).

Studies in the second category focus on the effect of different interventions or pathological conditions on functional connectivity and LFFs. Anesthesia, hypercapnia, and cocaine administration have been reported to disrupt functional connectivity (6-8). Also, changes in functional connectivity have been observed in conditions including autism, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and blindness (9-12).

The third group of studies addresses the origin of the LFFs. Physiological processes such as respiration can introduce spatially localized correlations in functional MRI data, and several groups have examined the effects of physiological noise on functional connectivity (13-16). Networks of correlated areas persisted despite significant attenuation of physiological noise, indicating that the noise is not the primary source of the correlation (15,17). Recent work by several groups has provided additional support for the neural basis of functional connectivity. A strong reduction of functional connectivity between hemispheres has been reported after surgical severance of the corpus callosum, the primary interhemispheric fiber tract. Intrahemispheric connectivity, however, was retained (18). It has also been shown that functional connectivity and the relationship between correlated networks is related to behavioral variability and the ability to learn new muscle synergies, more evidence that the correlated signal fluctuations are closely related to functional changes in the brain (19,20). Additional support comes from combined electroencephalography (EEG) -fMRI studies, although the findings are not consistent between the studies (21-24), possibly due to differences in the areas examined or recording methods used.

To better understand the relationship between neural activity and functional connectivity, several groups have recently turned to animal models (25-30). The use of animal models allows for more invasive experimental designs, which can give deeper insight into the LFFs. These studies have provided additional evidence of a link between coordinated neural activity and functional connectivity. Anesthesia-dependent changes in delta power correlation were shown to co-vary with changes in functional connectivity in rats, although the measurements were not performed simultaneously due to technical limitations (30). Shmuel and Leopold reported correlations between spontaneous neural activity and BOLD fluctuations in the visual cortex of monkeys in the absence of any stimulus (27). These results are an extension of previous work showing very slow (< 0.1 Hz) coherent oscillations in the band limited power of local field potentials obtained from monkey visual cortex (31).

Current functional connectivity analysis techniques such as cross-correlation of time-courses (1) or independent component analysis (ICA) (32) provide only steady-state information about networks where the relationship between the areas involved is assumed to be maintained over the entire length of the scan. These analysis methods do not give any information about the spatiotemporal dynamics of the LFFs. From EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies, it is known that behaviorally relevant changes in network activity occur on much shorter time scales than the minutes required for the acquisition of functional connectivity data. If the LFFs used to map functional connectivity have a neural basis, it should be possible to identify dynamic changes in network activity using MRI. In support of this idea, the envelope of EEG is shown to predict fluctuations in cerebral blood flow measured using laser Doppler flowmetry in rats (33). The spatiotemporal dynamics of the LFFs might, therefore, enhance our interpretation of functional connectivity data and provide us with clues to the origin of the low frequency fluctuations.

In this study, we report a preliminary investigation into the spatiotemporal dynamics of LFFs in the rodent model. The use of an animal model is conducive to future experiments combining functional connectivity MRI and electrophysiology. In addition, acquisition with very short repetition time (TR) and high spatial resolution is possible with the high-field animal scanners, which is necessary for obtaining spatiotemporal information from the data while avoiding aliasing. This will also allow us to address questions that remain unanswered for animal studies, including the relative contribution of different frequency components and the extent of physiological noise contamination. In previous animal studies, acquisition parameters did not allow the visualization of fine spectral details needed to address this issue. In addition, most animal studies were conducted using a fairly long repetition time and no physiological correction was performed. The contributions of respiration and the cardiac cycle have not been examined in the rodent model, and could be more severe than in humans due to the widespread use of high-field scanners (34).

In this study, we describe the acquisition of functional connectivity data from the rat with high temporal resolution that allows separation of the primary cardiac and respiratory components from the frequencies of interest. High spectral resolution allows the identification of two low frequency peaks in the data acquired from the rat cortex. The peaks exhibit different functional connectivity specificity. We further characterize spatiotemporal characteristics of both peaks and identify patterns of LFF propagation, which may not be deduced from typical functional connectivity analysis methods.}}

In this work, we show that individual spontaneous BOLD events occur during rest, in addition to slow fluctuations. Individual spontaneous BOLD events were identified by deconvolving the hemodynamic impulse response function for each time point in the fMRI time series, thus requiring no information on timing or a-priori spatial information of events. The patterns of activation detected were related to the motor, visual, default-mode, and dorsal attention networks. The correspondence between spontaneous events and slow fluctuations in these networks was assessed using a sliding window, seed-correlation analysis, where seed regions were selected based on the individual spontaneous event BOLD activity maps. We showed that the correlation varied considerably over time, peaking at the time of spontane- ous events in these networks. By regressing spontaneous events out of the fMRI signal, we showed that both the correlation strength and the power in spectral frequencies <0.1 Hz decreased, indicating that spontaneous activation events contribute to low-frequency fluctuations observed in resting state net- works with fMRI.

To this end, sparse linear regression methods have been previously used, including the well-known LASSO and the Dantzig selector. These methods generate a parametric family of solutions with different sparsity, among which a choice is finally based using some information criteria. As an alternative we propose a novel approach that instead utilizes the whole family of sparse regression solutions. Their ensemble provides a first approximation of probability of activation at each timepoint, and together with the conditional neuronal activity distributions estimated with the theory of mixtures with varying concentrations, they serve as the inputs to a Bayes classifier ultimately deciding between the true and false activations. As we show in extensive numerical simulations, the new method performs favourably in comparison with standard approaches in a range of realistic scenarios. This is mainly due to the avoidance of overfitting and underfitting that commonly plague the solutions based on sparse regression combined with model selection methods, including the corrected Akaike Information Criterion. This advantage is finally documented on fMRI task dataset.}}

Only recently was the dynamic behaviour of FC revealed, showing that on top of correlational patterns of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations, connectivity between different brain regions exhibits meaningful variations within a typical resting-state fMRI experiment. As a consequence, a considerable amount of work has been directed to assessing and characterising dynamic FC (dFC), and several different approaches were explored to identify relevant FC fluctuations. At the same time, several questions were raised about the nature of dFC, which would be of interest only if brought back to a neural origin. In support of this, correlations with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, demographic and behavioural data were established, and various clinical applications were explored, where the potential of dFC could be preliminarily demonstrated.

While the forward-backward algorithm cannot deal with more than $n = 1$ non-smooth function, our method generalizes it to the case of arbitrary $n$. Our method makes an explicit use of the regularity of $F$ in the forward step, and the proximity operators of the $G_i$'s are applied in parallel in the backward step. This allows the generalized forward backward to efficiently address an important class of convex problems. We prove its convergence in infinite dimension, and its robustness to errors on the computation of the proximity operators and of the gradient of $F$. Examples on inverse problems in imaging demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methods in comparison to other splitting algorithms.}}

The proposed method constitutes an alternative to the recently proposed Friston [Neuroimage 16 (2002) 513] method and has some advantages over it. The procedure is based on recent groundbreaking time series analysis techniques that have been, in this case, adopted to characterize hemodynamic responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This work represents a fundamental improvement over existing approaches to system identification using nonlinear hemodynamic models and is important for three reasons. First, our model includes physiological noise. Previous models have been based upon ordinary differential equations that only allow for noise or error to enter at the level of observation. Secondly, by using the innovation method and the local linearization filter, not only the parameters, but also the underlying states of the system generating responses can be estimated. These states can include things like a flow-inducing signal triggered by neuronal activation, de-oxyhemoglobine, cerebral blood flow and volume. Finally, radial basis functions have been introduced as a parametric model to represent arbitrary temporal input sequences in the hemodynamic approach, which could be essential to understanding those brain areas indirectly related to the stimulus. Hence, thirdly, by inferring about the radial basis parameters, we are able to perform a blind deconvolution, which permits both the reconstruction of the dynamics of the most likely hemodynamic states and also, to implicitly reconstruct the underlying synaptic dynamics, induced experimentally, which caused these states variations. From this study, we conclude that in spite of the utility of the standard discrete convolution approach used in statistical parametric maps (SPM), nonlinear BOLD phenomena and unspecific input temporal sequences must be included in the fMRI analysis.}}

Kappen},doi={},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={2792821121},journal={arXiv: Neurons and Cognition},abstract={Non-invasive methods to measure brain activity are important to understand cognitive processes in the human brain. A prominent example is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is a noisy measurement of a delayed signal that depends non-linearly on the neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling. These characteristics make the inference of neuronal activity from fMRI a difficult but important step in fMRI studies that require information at the neuronal level. In this article, we address this inference problem using a Bayesian approach where we model the latent neural activity as a stochastic process and assume that the observed BOLD signal results from a realistic physiological (Balloon) model. We apply a recently developed smoothing method called APIS to efficiently sample the posterior given single event fMRI time series. To infer neuronal signals with high likelihood for multiple time series efficiently, a modification of the original algorithm is introduced. We demonstrate that our adaptive procedure is able to compensate the lacking of inputs in the model to infer the neuronal activity and that it outperforms dramatically the standard bootstrap particle filter-smoother in this setting. This makes the proposed procedure especially attractive to deconvolve resting state fMRI data. To validate the method, we evaluate the quality of the signals inferred using the timing information contained in them. APIS obtains reliable event timing estimates based on fMRI data gathered during a reaction time experiment with short stimuli. Hence, we show for the first time that one can obtain accurate absolute timing of neuronal activity by reconstructing the latent neural signal.}}

To investigate this hypothesis, temporal correlations between cardiac rate and resting-state fMRI signal timecourses were assessed at 3 T. Resting-state BOLD fMRI and accompanying physiological data were acquired and analyzed using cross-correlation and regression. Time-shifted cardiac rate timecourses were included as regressors in addition to established physiological regressors (RETROICOR (Glover, G.H., Li, T.Q., Ress, D., 2000. Image-based method for retrospective correction of physiological motion effects in fMRI: RETROICOR. Magn Reson Med 44, 162–167) and respiration volume per unit time (Birn, R.M., Diamond, J.B., Smith, M.A., Bandettini, P.A., 2006b. Separating respiratory-variation-related fluctuations from neuronal-activity-related fluctuations in fMRI. NeuroImage 31, 1536–1548). Significant correlations between the cardiac rate and BOLD signal timecourses were revealed, particularly negative correlations in gray matter at time shifts of 6–12s and positive correlations at time shifts of 30–42s (TR=6s). Regressors consisting of cardiac rate timecourses shifted by delays of between 0 and 24s explained an additional 1% of the BOLD signal variance on average over the whole brain across 9 subjects, a similar additional variance to that explained by respiration volume per unit time and RETROICOR regressors, even when used in combination with these other physiological regressors. This suggests that including such time-shifted cardiac rate regressors will be beneficial for explaining physiological noise variance and will thereby improve the statistical power in future task-based and resting-state fMRI studies.}}

Since the sources of HRF variability can be nonneural in nature, the measured fMRI signal does not faithfully represent underlying neural activity. Therefore, it is advantageous to deconvolve the HRF from the fMRI signal. However, since both latent neural activity and the voxel-specific HRF is unknown, the deconvolution must be blind. Existing blind deconvolution approaches employ highly parameterized models, and it is unclear whether these models have an over fitting problem. In order to address these issues, we 1) present a nonparametric deconvolution method based on homomorphic filtering to obtain the latent neuronal response from the fMRI signal and, 2) compare our approach to the best performing existing parametric model based on the estimation of the biophysical hemodynamic model using the Cubature Kalman Filter/Smoother. We hypothesized that if the results from nonparametric deconvolution closely resembled that obtained from parametric deconvolution, then the problem of over fitting during estimation in highly parameterized deconvolution models of fMRI could possibly be over stated. Both simulations and experimental results demonstrate support for our hypothesis since the estimated latent neural response from both parametric and nonparametric methods were highly correlated in the visual cortex. Further, simulations showed that both methods were effective in recovering the simulated ground truth of the latent neural response.}}

Here, we explored the dynamical properties of large-scale functional brain networks derived from transient brain activity in fMRI. Spatial brain maps generally display significant modifications in terms of their tendency to occur across wakefulness and NREM sleep. Unexpectedly, almost all networks predominated in activity during NREM stage 2 before an abrupt loss of activity is observed in NREM stage 3. Yet, functional connectivity and mutual dependencies between these networks progressively broke down with increasing sleep depth. Thus, the efficiency of information transfer during NREM stage 2 is low despite the high attempt to communicate. Critically, our approach provides relevant data for evaluating functional brain network integrity and our findings robustly support a significant advance in our neural models of human sleep and consciousness.}}

The 'lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.}}

The SNR of the fMRI time-course was found to be near its asymptotic limit for moderate spatial resolution measurements at 3 T with only marginal gains expected from acquisition at higher field strengths. In this study, we investigate the amplitude of image intensity fluctuations in the fMRI time-course at magnetic field strengths of 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T as a function of image resolution, flip angle and TE. The time-course SNR was a similar function of the image SNR regardless of whether the image SNR was modulated by flip angle, image resolution, or field strength. For spatial resolutions typical of those currently used in fMRI (e.g., 3 × 3 × 3 mm3), increases in image SNR obtained from 7 T acquisition produced only modest increases in time-course SNR. At this spatial resolution, the ratio of physiological noise to thermal image noise was 0.61, 0.89, and 2.23 for 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T. At a resolution of 1 × 1 × 3 mm3, however, the physiological to thermal noise ratio was 0.34, 0.57, and 0.91 for 1.5 T, 3 T and 7 T for TE near T2*. Thus, by reducing the signal strength using higher image resolution, the ratio of physiologic to image noise could be reduced to a regime where increased sensitivity afforded by higher field strength still translated to improved SNR in the fMRI time-series.}}

It was recently shown that networks that are almost identical to the ones created from conventional correlation analysis can be obtained from a subset of high-amplitude data, suggesting that the functional networks may be driven by instantaneous co-activations of multiple brain regions rather than ongoing oscillatory processes. The rs-fMRI studies, however, rely on the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, which is only indirectly sensitive to neural activity through neurovascular coupling. To provide more direct evidence that the neuronal co-activation events produce the time-varying network patterns seen in rs-fMRI studies, we examined the simultaneous rs-fMRI and local field potential (LFP) recordings in rats performed in our lab over the past several years. We developed complementary analysis methods that focus on either the temporal or spatial domain, and found evidence that the interaction between LFP and BOLD may be driven by instantaneous co-activation events as well. BOLD maps triggered on high-amplitude LFP events resemble co-activation patterns created from rs-fMRI data alone, though the co-activation time points are defined differently in the two cases. Moreover, only LFP events that fall into the highest or lowest thirds of the amplitude distribution result in a BOLD signal that can be distinguished from noise. These findings provide evidence of an electrophysiological basis for the time-varying co-activation patterns observed in previous studies.}}

The analysis of large-scale brain network dynamics during rest is promising to investigate aberrant brain function and identify potentially more reliable biomarkers.    Methods  We retrieved and examined dynamic properties of large-scale functional brain networks using innovation-driven coactivation patterns. The study included resting-state functional magnetic resonance scans from 78 patients with 22q11DS and 85 healthy control subjects. After group comparison of temporal brain network activation properties, functional signatures of prodromal psychotic symptoms and anxiety were extracted using multivariate partial least squares correlation.    Results  Patients with 22q11DS had shorter activation in cognitive brain networks, longer activation in emotion processing networks, and generally increased segregation between brain networks. The functional signature of prodromal psychotic symptoms confirmed an implication of cingulo-prefrontal salience network activation duration and coupling. Further, the functional signature of anxiety uncovered an implication of amygdala activation and coupling, indicating differential roles of dorsal and ventral subdivisions of the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices. Coupling of amygdala with the dorsal anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices was promoting anxiety, whereas coupling with the ventral anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices had a protective function.    Conclusions  Using innovation-driven coactivation patterns for dynamic large-scale brain network analysis, we uncovered patterns of brain network activation duration and coupling that are relevant in clinical risk factors for psychosis in 22q11DS. Our results confirm that the dynamic nature of brain network activation contains essential function to develop clinically relevant imaging markers of psychosis vulnerability.}}
