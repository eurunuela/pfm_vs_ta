\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Talk about our motivation for this paper.

    \item We could mention iCAPs Neuron, and papers with applications like PFM, TA, clinical patient papers with iCAPs.

    \item Apart from [[Richard F. Betzel]]'s work, we could mention the connection with the [[Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives]] method

    \begin{itemize}
        \item See \cite{shine2015estimation}
        \item See \cite{shine2016dynamics}
        \item These are basically calculating the derivative, which is the same as applying a high-pass filter and calculating the correlation.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Here is a sample reference: \cite{gitelman2003modeling}.

\section{Theory}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is deconvolution and different formulations presented as a review.
    \item Analysis vs synthesis
    \begin{itemize}
        \item TA paper but without the spatial regularization
        \item PFM paper
        \item In gitelman it's an $\mathbf{H}$ multiplied by a fourier term.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Methods on how we're doing simulations and results (with simulations and experimental data)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different SNRs and maybe even use CAPs
        \item Selection of HRF explained if both use the same but it's different from what's used for simulating.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What happens? For example with gamma for simulating.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Selection of regularization parameter
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Present with real data on a voxel
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pros and cons of each formulation: analysis vs synthesis
    \item Link with other approaches
    \item Finish with conclusions and a moving forward
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We have to refine the deconvolution
        \item HRF variability there are three: conference proceeding by Philippe, ISBI 2012 by c√©sar, and Farouj with different formulation. Say conceptual differences among those.
        \item Mention stability-selection
        \item Debiasing
        \item Connected to debiasing other deconvolution algorithms that are based on norm lower than 1.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
