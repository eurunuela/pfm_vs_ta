  abstract = {The analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time-series data can provide information not only about task-related activity, but also about the connectivity (functional or effective) among regions and the influences of behavioral or physiologic states on that connectivity. Similar analyses have been performed in other imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography. However, fMRI is unique because the information about the underlying neuronal activity is filtered or convolved with a hemodynamic response function. Previous studies of regional connectivity in fMRI have overlooked this convolution and have assumed that the observed hemodynamic response approximates the neuronal response. In this article, this assumption is revisited using estimates of underlying neuronal activity. These estimates use a parametric empirical Bayes formulation for hemodynamic deconvolution. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Total variation (TV) is a powerful method that brings great benefit for edge-preserving regularization. Despite being widely employed in image processing, it has restricted applicability for 1-D signal processing since piecewise-constant signals form a rather limited model for many applications. Here we generalize conventional TV in 1-D by extending the derivative operator, which is within the regularization term, to any linear differential operator. This provides flexibility for tailoring the approach to the presence of nontrivial linear systems and for different types of driving signals such as spike-like, piecewise-constant, and so on. Conventional TV remains a special case of this general framework. We illustrate the feasibility of the method by considering a nontrivial linear system and different types of driving signals.},

This class of methods, which can be viewed as an ex- tension of the classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be significantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising nu- merical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude. Key},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a generalized forward-backward splitting algorithm for finding a zero of a sum of maximal monotone operators \$B + \textbackslash sum\_\{i=1\}\^n A\_i\$, where \$B\$ is cocoercive. It involves the computation of \$B\$ in an explicit (forward) step and the parallel computation of the resolvents of the \$A\_i\$'s in a subsequent implicit (backward) step. We prove the algorithm's convergence in infinite dimension and its robustness to summable errors on the computed operators in the explicit and implicit steps. In particular, this allows efficient minimization of the sum of convex functions \$f + \textbackslash sum\_\{i=1\}\^n g\_i\$, where \$f\$ has a Lipschitz-continuous gradient and each \$g\_i\$ is simple in the sense that its proximity operator is easy to compute. The resulting method makes use of the regularity of \$f\$ in the forward step, and the proximity operators of the \$g\_i\$'s are applied in parallel in the backward step. While the forward-backward algorithm cannot deal with more than \$n = 1\$ nonsmooth function, we generalize it to the case of arbitrary \$n\$. Examples on inverse problems in imaging demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methods in comparison to other splitting algorithms.},
