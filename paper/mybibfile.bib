Similar analyses have been performed in other imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography. However, {{fMRI}} is unique because the information about the underlying neuronal activity is filtered or convolved with a hemodynamic response function. Previous studies of regional connectivity in {{fMRI}} have overlooked this convolution and have assumed that the observed hemodynamic response approximates the neuronal response. In this article, this assumption is revisited using estimates of underlying neuronal activity. These estimates use a parametric empirical Bayes formulation for hemodynamic deconvolution. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Confirmatory approaches to {{fMRI}} data analysis look for evidence for the presence of pre-defined regressors modeling contributions to the voxel time series, including the BOLD response following neuronal activation. As more complicated questions arise about brain function, such as spontaneous and resting-state activity, new methodologies are required. We propose total activation (TA) as a novel {{fMRI}} data analysis method to explore the underlying activity-inducing signal of the BOLD signal without any timing information that is based on sparse spatio-temporal priors and characterization of the hemodynamic system. Within a variational framework, we formulate a convex cost function-including spatial and temporal regularization terms-that is solved by fast iterative shrinkage algorithms. The temporal regularization expresses that the activity-inducing signal is block-type without restrictions on the timing nor duration. The spatial regularization favors coherent activation patterns in anatomically-defined brain regions. TA is evaluated using a software phantom and an event-related {{fMRI}} experiment with prolonged resting state periods disturbed by visual stimuli. The results illustrate that both block-type and spike-type activities can be recovered successfully without prior knowledge of the experimental paradigm. Further processing using hierarchical clustering shows that the activity-inducing signals revealed by TA contain information about meaningful task-related and resting-state networks, demonstrating good abilities for the study of non-stationary dynamics of brain activity. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

This method is based on deconvolution of the hemodynamic response from the voxel time series assuming a linear response and using a ridge-regression algorithm. Statistical inference is performed by defining a spatio-temporal t-statistic and by controlling for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate procedure. The methodology was validated on five subjects who performed self-paced and visually cued finger tapping at 7 Tesla, with moderate (TR = 2 s) and high (TR = 0.4 s) temporal resolution. The results demonstrate that detection of single-trial BOLD events is feasible without a priori information on the stimulus paradigm. The proposed method opens up the possibility of designing temporally unconstrained paradigms to study the cortical response to unpredictable mental events.

  abstract = {The ability to detect single trial responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging ({{fMRI}}) studies is essential, particularly if investigating learning or adaptation processes or unpredictable events. We recently introduced paradigm free mapping (PFM), an analysis method that detects single trial blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses without specifying prior information on the timing of the events. PFM is based on the deconvolution of the {{fMRI}} signal using a linear hemodynamic convolution model. Our previous PFM method (Caballero-Gaudes et al., 2011: Hum Brain Mapp) used the ridge regression estimator for signal deconvolution and required a baseline signal period for statistical inference. In this work, we investigate the application of sparse regression techniques in PFM. In particular, a novel PFM approach is developed using the Dantzig selector estimator, solved via an efficient homotopy procedure, along with statistical model selection criteria. Simulation results demonstrated that, using the Bayesian information criterion to select the regularization parameter, this method obtains high detection rates of the BOLD responses, comparable with a model-based analysis, but requiring no information on the timing of the events and being robust against hemodynamic response function variability. The practical operation of this sparse PFM method was assessed with single-trial {{fMRI}} data acquired at 7T, where it automatically detected all task-related events, and was an improvement on our previous PFM method, as it does not require the definition of a baseline state and amplitude thresholding and does not compromise on specificity and sensitivity.},

Existing methods propose to estimate the HRF using the experimental paradigm (EP) in task {{fMRI}} as a surrogate of neural activity. These approaches induce a bias as they do not account for latencies in the cognitive responses compared to EP and cannot be applied to resting-state data as no EP is available. In this work, we formulate the joint estimation of the HRF and neural activation signal as a semi blind deconvolution problem. Its solution can be approximated using an efficient alternate minimization algorithm. The proposed approach is applied to task {{fMRI}} data for validation purpose and compared to a state-of-the-art HRF estimation technique. Numerical experiments suggest that our approach is competitive with others while not requiring EP information.},

This work proposes two improvements on the deconvolution algorithm of sparse paradigm free mapping (SPFM): a new formulation that enables the estimation of neuronal events with long, sustained activity; and the implementation of a subsampling approach based on stability selection that avoids the choice of any regularization parameter. The proposed method is evaluated on real {{fMRI}} data and compared with both the original SPFM algorithm and conventional analysis with a general linear model (GLM) that is aware of the temporal model of the neuronal-related activity. We demonstrate that the novel stability-based SPFM algorithm yields activation maps with higher resemblance to the maps obtained with GLM analyses and offers improved detection of neuronal-related events over SPFM, particularly in scenarios with low contrast-to-noise ratio.},

Despite being widely employed in image processing, it has restricted applicability for 1-D signal processing since piecewise-constant signals form a rather limited model for many applications. Here we generalize conventional TV in 1-D by extending the derivative operator, which is within the regularization term, to any linear differential operator. This provides flexibility for tailoring the approach to the presence of nontrivial linear systems and for different types of driving signals such as spike-like, piecewise-constant, and so on. Conventional TV remains a special case of this general framework. We illustrate the feasibility of the method by considering a nontrivial linear system and different types of driving signals.},

We analyzed 6 block-designed and 1 event-related designed functional MRI data, and examined whole-brain task modulated connectivity in various task domains, including emotion, reward, language, relation, social cognition, working memory, and inhibition. By using psychophysiological interaction between pairs of regions from the whole brain, we identified statistically significant task modulated connectivity in 4 tasks between their experimental and respective control conditions. Task modulated connectivity was found not only between regions that were activated during the task but also regions that were not activated or deactivated, suggesting a broader involvement of brain regions in a task than indicated by simple regional activations. Decreased functional connectivity was observed in all the 4 tasks and sometimes reduced connectivity was even between regions that were both activated during the task. This suggests that brain regions that are activated together do not necessarily work together. The current study demonstrates the comprehensive task connectomes of 4 tasks, and suggested complex relationships between regional activations and connectivity changes.},

  abstract = {Brain networks are flexible and reconfigure over time to support ongoing cognitive processes. However, tracking statistically meaningful reconfigurations across time has proven difficult. This has to do largely with issues related to sampling variability, making instantaneous estimation of network organization difficult, along with increased reliance on task-free (cognitively unconstrained) experimental paradigms, limiting the ability to interpret the origin of changes in network structure over time. Here, we address these challenges using time-varying network analysis in conjunction with a naturalistic viewing paradigm. Specifically, we developed a measure of inter-subject network similarity and used this measure as a coincidence filter to identify synchronous fluctuations in network organization across individuals. Applied to movie-watching data, we found that periods of high inter-subject similarity coincided with reductions in network modularity and increased connectivity between cognitive systems. In contrast, low inter-subject similarity was associated with increased system segregation and more rest-like architectures. We then used a data-driven approach to uncover clusters of functional connections that follow similar trajectories over time and are more strongly correlated during movie-watching than at rest. Finally, we show that synchronous fluctuations in network architecture over time can be linked to a subset of features in the movie. Our findings link dynamic fluctuations in network integration and segregation to patterns of inter-subject similarity, and suggest that moment-to-moment fluctuations in functional connectivity reflect shared cognitive processing across individuals.},

Moreover, it is well accepted that task engagement alters FC, and that dynamic estimates of FC during and before task events can help predict their nature and performance. Yet, when it comes to dynamic FC (dFC) during rest, there is no consensus about its origin or significance. Some argue that rest dFC reflects fluctuations in on-going cognition, or is a manifestation of intrinsic brain maintenance mechanisms, which could have predictive clinical value. Conversely, others have concluded that rest dFC is mostly the result of sampling variability, head motion or fluctuating sleep states. Here, we present novel analyses suggesting that rest dFC is influenced by short periods of spontaneous cognitive-task-like processes, and that the cognitive nature of such mental processes can be inferred blindly from the data. As such, several different behaviorally relevant whole-brain FC configurations may occur during a single rest scan even when subjects were continuously awake and displayed minimal motion. In addition, using low dimensional embeddings as visualization aids, we show how FC states\textemdash commonly used to summarize and interpret resting dFC\textemdash can accurately and robustly reveal periods of externally imposed tasks; however, they may be less effective in capturing periods of distinct cognition during rest.},

  abstract = {Functional and structural connections vary across conditions, measurements, and time. However, how to resolve multi-relational measures of connectivity remains an open challenge. Here, we propose an extension of structural covariance and morphometric similarity methods to integrate multiple estimates of connectivity into a single edge-centric network representation. We highlight the utility of this method through two applications: an analysis of multi-task functional connectivity data and multi-measure structural networks. In these analyses, we use data-driven clustering techniques to identify collections of edges that covary across tasks and measures, revealing overlapping mesoscale architecture. We also link these features to node-level properties such as modularity and canonical descriptors of brain systems. We further demonstrate that, in the case of multi-task functional networks, edge-level features are consistent across individuals yet exhibit subject-specificity. We conclude by highlighting other instances where the edge-centric model may be useful.},

Recent work has established that whole-brain functional connectivity 8 patterns are relatively stable within individuals and unique across individuals, and that features of 9 these patterns predict various traits. However, while functional connectivity is most often 10 measured at rest, certain tasks may enhance individual signals and improve sensitivity to 11 behavioral differences. Here, we show that compared to the resting state, functional connectivity 12 measured during naturalistic viewing-i.e., movie watching-yields more accurate predictions of 13 trait-like phenotypes in the both cognitive and emotional domains. Traits could be predicted using 14 less than three minutes of data from single video clips, and clips with highly social content gave 15 the most accurate predictions. Results suggest that naturalistic stimuli amplify individual 16 differences in behaviorally relevant brain networks.},

Yet relatively little work combines these two, perhaps because traditional analysis approaches for naturalistic imaging data are geared toward detecting shared responses rather than between-subject variability. Here, we review recent work using naturalistic stimuli to study individual differences, and advance a framework for detecting structure in idiosyncratic patterns of brain activity, or ``idiosynchrony''. Specifically, we outline the emerging technique of inter-subject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA), including its theoretical motivation and an empirical demonstration of how it recovers brain-behavior relationships during movie watching using data from the Human Connectome Project. We also consider how stimulus choice may affect the individual signal and discuss areas for future research. We argue that naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms have the potential to reveal meaningful individual differences above and beyond those observed during traditional tasks or at rest.},

Only a handful of studies have probed the organization of spinal resting-state fluctuations, always using static measures of connectivity. Many innovative approaches have emerged for analyzing dynamics of brain {{fMRI}}, but they have not yet been applied to the spinal cord, although they could help disentangle its functional architecture. Here, we leverage a dynamic connectivity method based on the clustering of hemodynamic-informed transients to unravel the rich dynamic organization of spinal resting-state signals. We test this approach in 19 healthy subjects, uncovering fine-grained spinal components and highlighting their neuroanatomical and physiological nature. We provide a versatile tool, the spinal innovation-driven co-activation patterns (SpiCiCAP) framework, to characterize spinal circuits during rest and task, as well as their disruption in neurological disorders.},

Decomposing resting-state {{fMRI}} using iCAPs reveals the rich spatiotemporal structure of functional components that dynamically assemble known resting-state networks. The temporal overlap between iCAPs is substantial; typically, three to four iCAPs occur simultaneously in combinations that are consistent with their behaviour profiles. In contrast to conventional connectivity analysis, which suggests a negative correlation between fluctuations in the default-mode network (DMN) and task-positive networks, we instead find evidence for two DMN-related iCAPs consisting the posterior cingulate cortex that differentially interact with the attention network. These findings demonstrate how the {{fMRI}} resting state can be functionally decomposed into spatially and temporally overlapping building blocks using iCAPs.},

Advances in data analysis have focussed on extracting the constituting elements of temporal dynamics in terms of activity or connectivity patterns. Subsequently, brain states can be defined and then be analyzed using temporal features and computational models as to capture subtle interactions between functional networks. These new methodological advances allow to deconstruct the rich spatiotemporal structure of functional components that dynamically assemble into resting-state networks long been observed using conventional measures of functional connectivity. Applications of these emerging methods demonstrate that changes in functional connectivity are indeed driven by complex reorganization of network interactions, and thus provide valuable observations to build better models of brain function and dysfunction.

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant.

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

The origin of these fluctuations is not clear but has previously been associated with slow changes in rhythmic neuronal activity resulting from changes in cortical excitability or neuronal synchronization. In this work, we show that individual spontaneous BOLD events occur during rest, in addition to slow fluctuations. Individual spontaneous BOLD events were identified by deconvolving the hemodynamic impulse response function for each time point in the {{fMRI}} time series, thus requiring no information on timing or a-priori spatial information of events. The patterns of activation detected were related to the motor, visual, default-mode, and dorsal attention networks. The correspondence between spontaneous events and slow fluctuations in these networks was assessed using a sliding window, seed-correlation analysis, where seed regions were selected based on the individual spontaneous event BOLD activity maps. We showed that the correlation varied considerably over time, peaking at the time of spontaneous events in these networks. By regressing spontaneous events out of the {{fMRI}} signal, we showed that both the correlation strength and the power in spectral frequencies {$<$}0.1 Hz decreased, indicating that spontaneous activation events contribute to low-frequency fluctuations observed in resting state networks with {{fMRI}}.

Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

It involves the computation of \$B\$ in an explicit (forward) step and the parallel computation of the resolvents of the \$A\_i\$'s in a subsequent implicit (backward) step. We prove the algorithm's convergence in infinite dimension and its robustness to summable errors on the computed operators in the explicit and implicit steps. In particular, this allows efficient minimization of the sum of convex functions \$f + \textbackslash sum\_\{i=1\}\^n g\_i\$, where \$f\$ has a Lipschitz-continuous gradient and each \$g\_i\$ is simple in the sense that its proximity operator is easy to compute. The resulting method makes use of the regularity of \$f\$ in the forward step, and the proximity operators of the \$g\_i\$'s are applied in parallel in the backward step. While the forward-backward algorithm cannot deal with more than \$n = 1\$ nonsmooth function, we generalize it to the case of arbitrary \$n\$. Examples on inverse problems in imaging demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methods in comparison to other splitting algorithms.},

  abstract = {Background Functional magnetic resonance imaging ({{fMRI}}) is commonly used to infer hemodynamic changes in the brain after increased neural activity, measuring the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. An important challenge in the analyses of {{fMRI}} data is to develop methods that can accurately deconvolve the BOLD signal to extract the driving neural activity and the underlying cerebrovascular effects. New method A biophysically based method is developed, which combines an extensively verified physiological hemodynamic model with a Wiener filter, to deconvolve the BOLD signal. Results The method is able to simultaneously obtain spatiotemporal images of underlying neurovascular signals, including neural activity, cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration. The method is tested on simulated data and applied to various experimental data to demonstrate its stability, accuracy, and utility. Comparison with existing methods The resulting profiles of the deconvolved signals are consistent with measurements reported in the literature, obtained via multiple neuroimaging modalities. Conclusions The method provides new testable predictions of the spatiotemporal relations of the deconvolved signals for future studies. This demonstrates the ability of the method to quantify and analyze the neurovascular mechanisms that underlie {{fMRI}}, thereby expanding its potential uses.},

In this review we conceptually organize a broad repertoire of dynamic analytical pipelines and extract general observations on their application to the study of behavior and brain disorders. We aim to provide an extensive overview instead of examining only selected methodological families or specific behavioral domains. We consider behavioral aspects with distinct long-term stability (e.g., physiological state versus personality), and also address selected brain disorders with complementary genetics and symptomatology. This synthesis exposes the somewhat limited consistency of dynamic findings in the literature, as well as the unbalanced application of the multitude of available approaches which would, owing to their technical specificities, have potential to reveal distinct aspects of dynamics. We call for further comparative and collaborative efforts in the future.},

  abstract        = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has highlighted the rich structure of brain activity in absence of a task or stimulus. A great effort has been dedicated in the last two decades to investigate functional connectivity (FC), i.e. the functional interplay between different regions of the brain, which was for a long time assumed to have stationary nature. Only recently was the dynamic behaviour of FC revealed, showing that on top of correlational patterns of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations, connectivity between different brain regions exhibits meaningful variations within a typical resting-state fMRI experiment. As a consequence, a considerable amount of work has been directed to assessing and characterising dynamic FC (dFC), and several different approaches were explored to identify relevant FC fluctuations. At the same time, several questions were raised about the nature of dFC, which would be of interest only if brought back to a neural origin. In support of this, correlations with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, demographic and behavioural data were established, and various clinical applications were explored, where the potential of dFC could be preliminarily demonstrated. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive description of the dFC approaches proposed so far, and point at the directions that we see as most promising for the future developments of the field. Advantages and pitfalls of dFC analyses are addressed, helping the readers to orient themselves through the complex web of available methodologies and tools.},

Knowledge of the spatiotemporal organization of these interactions is critical for establishing a solid understanding of the brain's functional architecture and the relationship between neural dynamics and cognition in health and disease. The possibility of studying these dynamics through careful analysis of neuroimaging data has catalyzed substantial interest in methods that estimate time-resolved fluctuations in functional connectivity (often referred to as "dynamic" or time-varying functional connectivity; TVFC). At the same time, debates have emerged regarding the application of TVFC analyses to resting fMRI data, and about the statistical validity, physiological origins, and cognitive and behavioral relevance of resting TVFC. These and other unresolved issues complicate interpretation of resting TVFC findings and limit the insights that can be gained from this promising new research area. This article brings together scientists with a variety of perspectives on resting TVFC to review the current literature in light of these issues. We introduce core concepts, define key terms, summarize controversies and open questions, and present a forward-looking perspective on how resting TVFC analyses can be rigorously and productively applied to investigate a wide range of questions in cognitive and systems neuroscience.},

Most current analysis methods hypothesise sustained FC within the duration of a task, but this assumption has been shown too limiting by recent imaging studies. While several methods have been proposed to study functional dynamics during rest, task-based studies are yet to fully disentangle network modulations. Here, we propose a seed-based method to probe task-dependent modulations of brain activity by revealing Psychophysiological Interactions of Co-activation Patterns (PPI-CAPs). This point process-based approach temporally decomposes task-modulated connectivity into dynamic building blocks which cannot be captured by current methods, such as PPI or Dynamic Causal Modelling. Additionally, it identifies the occurrence of co-activation patterns at single frame resolution as opposed to window-based methods. In a naturalistic setting where participants watched a TV program, we retrieved several patterns of co-activation with a posterior cingulate cortex seed whose occurrence rates and polarity varied depending on the context; on the seed activity; or on an interaction between the two. Moreover, our method exposed the consistency in effective connectivity patterns across subjects and time, allowing us to uncover links between PPI-CAPs and specific stimuli contained in the video. Our study reveals that explicitly tracking connectivity pattern transients is paramount to advance our understanding of how different brain areas dynamically communicate when presented with a set of cues.},

We aimed to characterize large-scale modulatory interactions by performing region-of-interest (ROI)-based physiophysiological interaction analysis on resting-state fMRI data. Modulatory interactions were calculated for every possible combination of three ROIs among 160 ROIs sampling the whole brain. Firstly, among all of the significant modulatory interactions, there were considerably more negative than positive effects; i.e., in more cases, an increase of activity in one region was associated with decreased functional connectivity between two other regions. Next, modulatory interactions were categorized as to whether the three ROIs were from one single network module, two modules, or three different modules (defined by a modularity analysis on their functional connectivity). Positive modulatory interactions were more represented than expected in cases in which the three ROIs were from a single module, suggesting an increase within module processing efficiency through positive modulatory interactions. In contrast, negative modulatory interactions were more represented than expected in cases in which the three ROIs were from two modules, suggesting a tendency of between-module segregation through negative modulatory interactions. Regions that were more likely to have modulatory interactions were then identified. The numbers of significant modulatory interactions for different regions were correlated with the regions' connectivity strengths and connection degrees. These results demonstrate whole-brain characteristics of modulatory interactions and may provide guidance for future studies of connectivity dynamics in both resting state and task state.},

Functional connectivity measures usually assume a stable relationship over time; however, accumulating studies have reported time-varying properties of strength and spatial distribution of functional connectivity. The present study explored the modulation of functional connectivity between two regions by a third region using the physiophysiological interaction (PPI) technique. We first identified eight brain networks and two regions of interest (ROIs) representing each of the networks using a spatial independent component analysis. A voxel-wise analysis was conducted to identify regions that showed modulatory interactions (PPI) with the two ROIs of each network. Mostly, positive modulatory interactions were observed within regions involved in the same system. For example, the two regions of the dorsal attention network revealed modulatory interactions with the regions related to attention, while the two regions of the extrastriate network revealed modulatory interactions with the regions in the visual cortex. In contrast, the two regions of the default mode network (DMN) revealed negative modulatory interactions with the regions in the executive network, and vice versa, suggesting that the activities of one network may be associated with smaller within network connectivity of the competing network. These results validate the use of PPI analysis to study modulation of resting-state functional connectivity by a third region. The modulatory effects may provide a better understanding of complex brain functions.},

  abstract        = {Neuroimaging methodology predominantly relies on the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. While the BOLD signal is a valid measure of neuronal activity, variances in fluctuations of the BOLD signal are not only due to fluctuations in neural activity. Thus, a remaining problem in neuroimaging analyses is developing methods that ensure specific inferences about neural activity that are not confounded by unrelated sources of noise in the BOLD signal. Here, we develop and test a new algorithm for performing semiblind (i.e., no knowledge of stimulus timings) deconvolution of the BOLD signal that treats the neural event as an observable, but intermediate, probabilistic representation of the system's state. We test and compare this new algorithm against three other recent deconvolution algorithms under varied levels of autocorrelated and Gaussian noise, hemodynamic response function (HRF) misspecification and observation sampling rate. Further, we compare the algorithms' performance using two models to simulate BOLD data: a convolution of neural events with a known (or misspecified) HRF versus a biophysically accurate balloon model of hemodynamics. We also examine the algorithms' performance on real task data. The results demonstrated good performance of all algorithms, though the new algorithm generally outperformed the others (3.0% improvement) under simulated resting-state experimental conditions exhibiting multiple, realistic confounding factors (as well as 10.3% improvement on a real Stroop task). The simulations also demonstrate that the greatest negative influence on deconvolution accuracy is observation sampling rate. Practical and theoretical implications of these results for improving inferences about neural activity from fMRI BOLD signal are discussed.},

However, recent work has called into question the value of causal inference computed directly from BOLD, demonstrating that valid inferences require transformation of the BOLD signal into its underlying neural events as necessary for accurate causal inference. In this work we develop an approach for effective connectivity estimation directly from deconvolution-based features and estimates of inter-regional communication lag. We then test, in both simulation as well as whole-brain fMRI BOLD signal, the viability of this approach. Our results show that deconvolution precision and network size play outsized roles in effective connectivity estimation performance. Idealized simulation conditions allow for statistically significant effective connectivity estimation of networks of up to four hundred regions-of-interest (ROIs). Under simulation of realistic recording conditions and deconvolution performance, however, our result indicates that effective connectivity is viable in networks containing up to approximately sixty ROIs. We then validated the ability for the proposed method to reliably detect effective connectivity in whole-brain fMRI signal parcellated into networks of viable size.},

Here, we develop and test a new meta-algorithm for conducting semi-blind (i.e., no knowledge of stimulus timings) deconvolution of the BOLD signal that estimates, via bootstrapping, both the underlying neural events driving BOLD as well as the confidence of these estimates. Our approach includes two improvements over the current best performing deconvolution approach; 1) we optimize the parametric form of the deconvolution feature space; and, 2) we pre-classify neural event estimates into two subgroups, either known or unknown, based on the confidence of the estimates prior to conducting neural event classification. This knows-what-it-knows approach significantly improves neural event classification over the current best performing algorithm, as tested in a detailed computer simulation of highly-confounded fMRI BOLD signal. We then implemented a massively parallelized version of the bootstrapping-based deconvolution algorithm and executed it on a high-performance computer to conduct large scale (i.e., voxelwise) estimation of the neural events for a group of 17 human subjects. We show that by restricting the computation of inter-regional correlation to include only those neural events estimated with high-confidence the method appeared to have higher sensitivity for identifying the default mode network compared to a standard BOLD signal correlation analysis when compared across subjects.},

  abstract        = {The General Linear Model (GLM) used in task-fMRI relates activated brain areas to extrinsic task conditions. The translation of resulting neural activation into a hemodynamic response is commonly approximated with a linear convolution model using a hemodynamic response function (HRF). There are two major limitations in GLM analysis. Firstly, the GLM assumes that neural activation is either on or off and matches the exact stimulus duration in the corresponding task timings. Secondly, brain networks observed in resting-state fMRI experiments present also during task experiments, but the GLM approach models these task-unrelated brain activity as noise. A novel kernel matrix factorization approach, called hemodynamic matrix factorization (HMF), is therefore proposed that addresses both limitations by assuming that task-related and task-unrelated brain activity can be modeled with the same convolution model as in GLM analysis. By contrast to the GLM, the proposed HMF is a blind source separation (BSS) technique, which decomposes fMRI data into modes. Each mode comprises of a neural activation time course and a spatial mapping. Two versions of HMF are proposed in which the neural activation time course of each mode is convolved with either the canonical HRF or predetermined subject-specific HRFs. Firstly, HMF with the canonical HRF is applied to two open-source cohorts. These cohorts comprise of several task experiments including motor, incidental memory, spatial coherence discrimination, verbal discrimination task and a very short localization task, engaging multiple parts of the eloquent cortex. HMF modes were obtained whose neural activation time course followed original task timings and whose corresponding spatial map matched cortical areas known to be involved in the respective task processing. Secondly, the alignment of these neural activation time courses to task timings were further improved by replacing the canonical HRF with subject-specific HRFs during HMF mode computation. In addition to task-related modes, HMF also produced seemingly task-unrelated modes whose spatial maps matched known resting-state networks. The validity of a fMRI task experiment relies on the assumption that the exposure to a stimulus for a given time causes an imminent increase in neural activation of equal duration. The proposed HMF is an attempt to falsify this assumption and allows to identify subject task participation that does not comply with the experiment instructions.},

This standard approach leads to simple learning procedures, yet it is ill-suited for decoding events with short inter-stimulus intervals. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a novel framework that separates the spatial and temporal components of the prediction by decoding the fMRI time-series continuously, i.e. scan-by-scan. The stimulation events can then be identified through a deconvolution of the reconstructed time series. We show that this model performs as well as or better than standard approaches across several datasets, most notably in regimes with small inter-stimuli intervals (3-5s), while also offering predictions that are highly interpretable in the time domain. This opens the way toward analyzing datasets not normally thought of as suitable for decoding and makes it possible to run decoding on studies with reduced scan time.},

  abstract        = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an indirect measure of neural activity which is modeled as a convolution of the latent neuronal response and the hemodynamic response function (HRF). Since the sources of HRF variability can be nonneural in nature, the measured fMRI signal does not faithfully represent underlying neural activity. Therefore, it is advantageous to deconvolve the HRF from the fMRI signal. However, since both latent neural activity and the voxel-specific HRF is unknown, the deconvolution must be blind. Existing blind deconvolution approaches employ highly parameterized models, and it is unclear whether these models have an over fitting problem. In order to address these issues, we 1) present a nonparametric deconvolution method based on homomorphic filtering to obtain the latent neuronal response from the fMRI signal and, 2) compare our approach to the best performing existing parametric model based on the estimation of the biophysical hemodynamic model using the Cubature Kalman Filter/Smoother. We hypothesized that if the results from nonparametric deconvolution closely resembled that obtained from parametric deconvolution, then the problem of over fitting during estimation in highly parameterized deconvolution models of fMRI could possibly be over stated. Both simulations and experimental results demonstrate support for our hypothesis since the estimated latent neural response from both parametric and nonparametric methods were highly correlated in the visual cortex. Further, simulations showed that both methods were effective in recovering the simulated ground truth of the latent neural response.},

  abstract      = {Non-invasive methods to measure brain activity are important to understand cognitive processes in the human brain. A prominent example is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is a noisy measurement of a delayed signal that depends non-linearly on the neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling. These characteristics make the inference of neuronal activity from fMRI a difficult but important step in fMRI studies that require information at the neuronal level. In this article, we address this inference problem using a Bayesian approach where we model the latent neural activity as a stochastic process and assume that the observed BOLD signal results from a realistic physiological (Balloon) model. We apply a recently developed smoothing method called APIS to efficiently sample the posterior given single event fMRI time series. To infer neuronal signals with high likelihood for multiple time series efficiently, a modification of the original algorithm is introduced. We demonstrate that our adaptive procedure is able to compensate the lacking of inputs in the model to infer the neuronal activity and that it outperforms dramatically the standard bootstrap particle filter-smoother in this setting. This makes the proposed procedure especially attractive to deconvolve resting state fMRI data. To validate the method, we evaluate the quality of the signals inferred using the timing information contained in them. APIS obtains reliable event timing estimates based on fMRI data gathered during a reaction time experiment with short stimuli. Hence, we show for the first time that one can obtain accurate absolute timing of neuronal activity by reconstructing the latent neural signal.},

  abstract        = {Kalman filtering methods have long been regarded as efficient adaptive Bayesian techniques for estimating hidden states in models of linear dynamical systems under Gaussian uncertainty. Recent advents of the Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) have extended this efficient estimation property to nonlinear systems, and also to hybrid nonlinear problems where by the processes are continuous and the observations are discrete (continuous-discrete CD-CKF). Employing CKF techniques, therefore, carries high promise for modeling many biological phenomena where the underlying processes exhibit inherently nonlinear, continuous, and noisy dynamics and the associated measurements are uncertain and time-sampled. This paper investigates the performance of cubature filtering (CKF and CD-CKF) in two flagship problems arising in the field of neuroscience upon relating brain functionality to aggregate neurophysiological recordings: (i) estimation of the firing dynamics and the neural circuit model parameters from electric potentials (EP) observations, and (ii) estimation of the hemodynamic model parameters and the underlying neural drive from BOLD (fMRI) signals. First, in simulated neural circuit models, estimation accuracy was investigated under varying levels of observation noise (SNR), process noise structures, and observation sampling intervals (dt). When compared to the CKF, the CD-CKF consistently exhibited better accuracy for a given SNR, sharp accuracy increase with higher SNR, and persistent error reduction with smaller dt. Remarkably, CD-CKF accuracy shows only a mild deterioration for non-Gaussian process noise, specifically with Poisson noise, a commonly assumed form of background fluctuations in neuronal systems. Second, in simulated hemodynamic models, parametric estimates were consistently improved under CD-CKF. Critically, time-localization of the underlying neural drive, a determinant factor in fMRI-based functional connectivity studies, was significantly more accurate under CD-CKF. In conclusion, and with the CKF recently benchmarked against other advanced Bayesian techniques, the CD-CKF framework could provide significant gains in robustness and accuracy when estimating a variety of biological phenomena models where the underlying process dynamics unfold at time scales faster than those seen in collected measurements.},

  abstract        = {This paper presents a new approach to inverting (fitting) models of coupled dynamical systems based on state-of-the-art (cubature) Kalman filtering. Crucially, this inversion furnishes posterior estimates of both the hidden states and parameters of a system, including any unknown exogenous input. Because the underlying generative model is formulated in continuous time (with a discrete observation process) it can be applied to a wide variety of models specified with either ordinary or stochastic differential equations. These are an important class of models that are particularly appropriate for biological time-series, where the underlying system is specified in terms of kinetics or dynamics (i.e., dynamic causal models). We provide comparative evaluations with generalized Bayesian filtering (dynamic expectation maximization) and demonstrate marked improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency. We compare the schemes using a series of difficult (nonlinear) toy examples and conclude with a special focus on hemodynamic models of evoked brain responses in fMRI. Our scheme promises to provide a significant advance in characterizing the functional architectures of distributed neuronal systems, even in the absence of known exogenous (experimental) input; e.g., resting state fMRI studies and spontaneous fluctuations in electrophysiological studies. Importantly, unlike current Bayesian filters (e.g. DEM), our scheme provides estimates of time-varying parameters, which we will exploit in future work on the adaptation and enabling of connections in the brain.},

  abstract        = {In this paper, we aimed for the robust estimation of the parameters and states of the hemodynamic model by using blood oxygen level dependent signal. In the fMRI literature, there are only a few successful methods that are able to make a joint estimation of the states and parameters of the hemodynamic model. In this paper, we implemented a maximum likelihood based method called the particle smoother expectation maximization (PSEM) algorithm for the joint state and parameter estimation. Former sequential Monte Carlo methods were only reliable in the hemodynamic state estimates. They were claimed to outperform the local linearization (LL) filter and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The PSEM algorithm is compared with the most successful method called square-root cubature Kalman smoother (SCKS) for both state and parameter estimation. SCKS was found to be better than the dynamic expectation maximization (DEM) algorithm, which was shown to be a better estimator than EKF, LL and particle filters. PSEM was more accurate than SCKS for both the state and the parameter estimation. Hence, PSEM seems to be the most accurate method for the system identification and state estimation for the hemodynamic model inversion literature. This paper do not compare its results with Tikhonov-regularized Newton-CKF (TNF-CKF), a recent robust method which works in filtering sense.},

  abstract        = {This paper presents a variational treatment of dynamic models that furnishes time-dependent conditional densities on the path or trajectory of a system's states and the time-independent densities of its parameters. These are obtained by maximising a variational action with respect to conditional densities, under a fixed-form assumption about their form. The action or path-integral of free-energy represents a lower bound on the model's log-evidence or marginal likelihood required for model selection and averaging. This approach rests on formulating the optimisation dynamically, in generalised coordinates of motion. The resulting scheme can be used for online Bayesian inversion of nonlinear dynamic causal models and is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Kalman and particle filtering. Furthermore, it provides for dual and triple inferences on a system's states, parameters and hyperparameters using exactly the same principles. We refer to this approach as dynamic expectation maximisation (DEM).},

  abstract        = {In this paper, a new procedure is presented which allows the estimation of the states and parameters of the hemodynamic approach from blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses. The proposed method constitutes an alternative to the recently proposed Friston [Neuroimage 16 (2002) 513] method and has some advantages over it. The procedure is based on recent groundbreaking time series analysis techniques that have been, in this case, adopted to characterize hemodynamic responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This work represents a fundamental improvement over existing approaches to system identification using nonlinear hemodynamic models and is important for three reasons. First, our model includes physiological noise. Previous models have been based upon ordinary differential equations that only allow for noise or error to enter at the level of observation. Secondly, by using the innovation method and the local linearization filter, not only the parameters, but also the underlying states of the system generating responses can be estimated. These states can include things like a flow-inducing signal triggered by neuronal activation, de-oxyhemoglobine, cerebral blood flow and volume. Finally, radial basis functions have been introduced as a parametric model to represent arbitrary temporal input sequences in the hemodynamic approach, which could be essential to understanding those brain areas indirectly related to the stimulus. Hence, thirdly, by inferring about the radial basis parameters, we are able to perform a blind deconvolution, which permits both the reconstruction of the dynamics of the most likely hemodynamic states and also, to implicitly reconstruct the underlying synaptic dynamics, induced experimentally, which caused these states variations. From this study, we conclude that in spite of the utility of the standard discrete convolution approach used in statistical parametric maps (SPM), nonlinear BOLD phenomena and unspecific input temporal sequences must be included in the fMRI analysis.},
